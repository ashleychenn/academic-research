<b>Perceptions of Digital vs. Traditional Advertising</b>
<br>A survey of attitudes and beliefs toward traditional and digital advertising.</br>
<p>For my graduate thesis, I researched attitudes and beliefs of emerging digital advertising methods and how they compared to traditional advertising, using Q-Methodology. Q-Methodology is a form of factor analysis that can effectively measures attitudes and beliefs, a difficult data set to measure because there is often overlap and conflicting responses. At the time of data collection, all groups exhibited high levels of distrust toward emerging digital advertising methods.</p>
