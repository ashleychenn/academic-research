<b>Perceptions of Digital vs. Traditional Advertising</b>
<br>A survey of attitudes and beliefs toward traditional and digital advertising.</br>
<p>For my graduate thesis, I researched attitudes and beliefs of emerging digital advertising methods and how they compared to traditional advertising, using Q-Methodology. Q-Methodology is a form of factor analysis that can effectively measures attitudes and beliefs, a difficult data set to measure because there is often overlap and conflicting responses. At the time of data collection, all groups exhibited high levels of distrust toward emerging digital advertising methods.</p>


<b>Editorial Content Shift in Seventeen Magazine</b>
<br>Content Analysis on Editorial Changes at Long-running Magazine</br>
<p>In this study, I looked at how content in the popular teen magazine, <i>Seventeen</i> shifted during a period of great social change (late 1970s to late 1980s). Magazines like <i>Seventeen</i> can play a significant role in influencing what young women think about and how they think about it. I presented my study at the Far West Popular Culture Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.</p>
